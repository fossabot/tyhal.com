    "summary": "Started programming in high-school, leaving a year early with a scholarship to Waikato University while simultaneously being part of building Nyriad. Actively jumped into new and existing projects which required leadership, management, and problem solving • Developer who likes to explore different areas of programming, typically found trying out faster and automated ways to improve CI/CD, machine infrastructure and anything that causes developer friction • Heavily involved in building infrastructure that supports Nvidia GPUs, including effective storage and data science stacks that use them • This lead to following Dev-Ops practices and has been a key aspect of working with tools such as Kubernetes, Kibana, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins.",
