    "summary": "I'm a developer who likes to explore different areas of programming, you will typically see me trying out faster and more automated ways to improve CI/CD, Machine Infrastructure and anything else that causes developer friction.\n\nI've been heavily involved in building infrastructure that supports Nvidia GPUs as well as effective storage and data science stacks that use them. This lead me to following Dev-Ops practises and has been a key aspect of working with tools such as Kubernetes, Kibana, Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and Jenkins.\n\nI started programming in high-school, leaving a year early with a scholarship to Waikato University while simultaneously being part of building Nyriad. I have actively jumped into new and existing projects where I have helped with leadership, management, and development problem solving.",
